# Mlog Sokoban

This is a remake of sokoban for mindustry logic, using my own transpiler.

## Building

To build it clone the repo for this, and `https://github.com/SkyeTheFoxyFox/sfmlog-4`

Then just run `python3 sfmlog.py -s main.sfmlog -c`, replace the paths with the correct ones.

Then you can import the schem from clipboard in mindustry.
